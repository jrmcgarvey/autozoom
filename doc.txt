To get the program to run automatically, I added a value at this registry location:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

I set a new value called autozoom, with this value:

"C:\Windows\System32\wscript.exe" C:\users\xxxx\autozoom\runNode.vbs

It's possible that this is not the best way to do it.  It may be that the
right way is to use

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

as described here

or to put an entry in the startup folder as described here:
